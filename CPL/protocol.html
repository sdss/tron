<h1>Hub Protocol</h1>

  <p>The hub negotiates between <b>Commanders</b> and <b>Actors</b>
via a textual, line-based, command-and-response protocol. This
protocol is intended to be simple to implement and conform to: we want
to encourage development.

<h2>Command Requests</h2>

<b>MID CID Actor Command</b>

  <p>Request that the command string <b>Command</b> be sent,
  un-molested, to the target <b>Actor</b>. Responses to the command
  will be returned to the caller labelled with <b>MID</b>, as defined
  by the <a href="#Command_Responses">Command Response protocol</a>. 

  The <b>CID</b> argument can be used to specify the source of the
  command. <p>For simple callers, it can be left as <b>0</b>. Whatever
  is passed to the hub will be returned to the caller.

  <p><b>MID</b>s must be positive, incrementing integers.
  <p><b>CID</b>s must be one or more non-negative integers, separated
  by single periods. <i>e.g. 0, 0.1, 1.99</i>
