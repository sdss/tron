    Data includes information necessary to connect to this device

    - Send commands to the device
    - Parse all replies and use that information to:
      - Output appropriate data to the users
      - Upate a device model, if one exists
      - Call callbacks associated with the command, if any

    Inputs:
    - name      a short name to identify the device
    - conn      a connection to the device; more information below
    - cmdInfo   a list of (user command verb, device command verb, help string)
                for commands that are be sent directly through to this device.
                Specify None for the device command verb if it is the same as the user command verb
                (high recommended as it is much easier for the user to figure out what is going on)
    - callFunc  function to call when state of device changes;
                note that it is NOT called when the connection state changes;
                register a callback with "conn" for that task.

    conn is an object implementing these methods:
    - connect()
    - disconnect()
    - addStateCallback(callFunc, callNow=True)
    - getFullState(): Returns the current state as a tuple:
        - state: a numeric value; named constants are available
        - stateStr: a short string describing the state
        - reason: the reason for the state ("" if none)
    - isConnected(): return True if connected, False otherwise
    - isDone(): return True if fully connected or disconnected
    - addReadCallback(callFunc, callNow=True)
    - writeLine(str)
    and this is traditional:
    - readLine()
