  The fundamental 3.5m protocol is essentially unchanged from the
original design. While it is probably not a design we would choose
now, is is implemented by the TCC and three of the instrument ICCs;
radically changing it would require more work than we can put in.

  Besides, it is more-or-less OK. The flaws are real, but the
simplicity is appealing.
  
    - Commanders send commands to Actors. (sorry about the cheesy
    C.S. 201 terminology). The commands must be single ASCII lines.

    - Each command is given an identifying numeric MID by the
    Commander, which is used to identify which command responses apply
    to.

    -     

Commands are identified by the following:
    
cmdrID  - established at login or startup by the hub, so it is known
          to be trustworthy and unique. Is composed of two strings
          joined by a period. In the case of logged in connections,
          the two parts are the observing program name and the user's
          chosen name. In the case of other Commanders, the left part
          is empty, and the right part is established by the hub.
cmdrMID - an integer command ID, supplied by the Commander. 

actorName - the name of the actor to send the command to.
actorMID  - an integer command ID, supplied by the hub to the actor.
[actorCID  - the cmdrID, if the actor wants it]

Replies are identified by all the Command info above, plus:
src       - the name of the actor which actually generated the
            reply. Almost always the actorName, but can be a few other
            things; most obviously 'hub' when the hub rejects a
            command or otherwise injects itself.

========================

  The ID protocol between the hub and actors and between the hub and
  commanders is slightly different. In general, for actors, 

hub sends a sequence of commands:
  MID commandText

For each such command, actors reply with:
  CID MID flag KVs

  CID - a numeric ID indicating the source of the command. The hub
connection is assigned a positive integer when the connection between
the hub and the actor is established. A CID of 0 indicates that
the reply was internally generated (controller resets, temperature
monitoring output, etc, etc). 
  MID - a numeric ID unique to a given command for a given CID, and
  assigned by the command sender (the hub, say). The hub sends
  sequential, positive IDs, and might treat an ID of 0 specially.
