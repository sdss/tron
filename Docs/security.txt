  The current hub uses the connecting machine's IP address for
authorizing connections, and does not encrypt the traffic between
clients and the hub. It is worth considering options for the new hub
and TUI. 
  Some issues go away, and so are not worth discussing. The existing
callback mechanism that upsets so mant firewalls goes, as does the
system of ftping back to a sender machine, with all negotiations
transferred in plain text. 

Authorization:

  - Leave the current scheme. I object, only because we can no longer
  count on the client being a dumb single-user Mac.

  - Require passwords.
