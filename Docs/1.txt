What was the original design:

  The original software architecture for 3.5m operations was designed
around the necessity of incorporating heterogeneous, distributed
systems. A simple

What are the problems:

  Remark has served APO very well, and does still work. But it has
  some flaws which are starting to hamper operations:

   - APO does not have the source code. Even if we did, it would be in
   Yerk. So Remark is basically frozen.
   
   - Yerk runs only on Macs.

   - The connection protocol was designed before firewalls, and looks
   for all the world like an enemy attack to the remote institutions.

What are we doing:

  Russell Owen was contracted to write a new GUI interface for the
3.5m operations. The only constraints were that the result be
reasonably platform independant and that the programming language and
style facilitate and even encourage others to modify or extend the
program.

What are we not doing:

  This is a shoestring operation, and we are explicitly not
  redesigning the s/w architecture. We are keeping the simple
  single layer command-response protocol
