FITS handling. Yup. Fun.

  Need FITS creation for Grim and the Echelle.
  Need FITS annotation for DIS, the DIS slitviewer, the two GIm cameras.

  fits getSystemHeader instName [time]
    - Fetch the system headers.

  fits addCards inst name=type,value name2=type,value

  fits create instName in=datafile out=fitsfile xpix=N ypix=M
    - Take datafile, interpreted as an xpix by ypix array, add any previously generated header,
      and write the result to out.

  fits annotate instName in=datafile out=fitsfile
    - Take and input FITS file, add any previously generated header lines,
      and write the result to out.
