The 3.5m currently has three "guiders":

 - the echelle slitviewer ("ecam")
 - the NA2 offset guider ("gcam")
 - the DIS slitviewer ("dcam")

 The file and name spaces for all are simple:
  - Each has a more or less fixed directory.
  - Each has a filename pattern which includes a sequence number.
  - Each has a sequence number limit.
  - Exposures always take the next sequence number, or wrap at the limit. Exposures _overwrite_ existing files.

All, at the least, need to:

 - expose a window:
        expose itime=N [window=X0,Y0,X1,Y1]

        Returns:
           gcamImage=filename

 - take a dark frame:
        dark itime=N

        Returns:
           gcamDark=filename

 - set up:
        init
        
        Returns:
           gcamPath=host,path

           where the images will be available in ftp://host/path/

Some, or all, need to:

 - find objects that can be centroided on:
        findstars itime=N [window=X0,Y0,X1,Y1] [limit=N]

        Returns a list of centroids.

        i gcamImage=filename
        : gcamStars=N,s1,s2,...sN where sN=x,y,?,?
           or
        f gcamTxt="No stars found"

 - centroid on a [given] star:
        centroid itime=N [on=x,y] [window=X0,Y0,X1,Y1]

        If no center is given, findstars is called, and the first (best) object is used.

        Return details about the centroiding

        i gcamImage=filename
        : gcamCentroid=x,y,?,?,?
           or
        f gcamTxt="No star found"

Some need to set masks:
 - setCurrentMask (itime=N or filename=F)
